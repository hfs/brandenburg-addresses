# Using the data in JOSM

The JOSM version must be **18578** or newer. You can download a recent version
from the [JOSM site](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/) if you donâ€™t have it, yet.

You can find this data in the menu *Imagery* â€º *Brandenburg GeoBasis-DE/LGB
(2024): Georeferenzierte Adresse*. You have to be in Brandenburg with the main
map for the menu entry to be shown.
