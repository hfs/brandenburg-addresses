## Background info

The basic geo data of the state of Brandenburg (in Germany) are available as
Open Data under the license “Data licence Germany – attribution – version 2.0
[dl/de/by-2.0](https://www.govdata.de/dl-de/by-2-0)”. This includes the
[Georeferenced Addresses (house number coordinates)](https://geobasis-bb.de/lgb/de/geodaten/liegenschaftskataster/georeferenzierte-adresse/).
Since April 2020 it is possible to use this data in OpenStreetMap.

This project provides the Georeferenced Addresses as background layer for the
[OpenStreetMap editor JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/).
The official addresses are compared to the ones on OpenStreetMap. Those
addresses that might be missing in OpenStreetMap are highlighted.
