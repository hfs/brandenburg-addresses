# Tips for editing addresses in JOSM


## Use the template

Via *Presets ‚Ä∫ Search preset‚Ä¶ ‚Ä∫ Annotation/Address* you can get a
dialogue which makes it easier to add add multiple addresses. The dialogue
remembers everything except the house number between onvocations. If you want
to add several house numbers in one street, you need to enter the street name,
postcode etc. only once. For the next house you only have to enter the house
number.

With the buttons `+1`, `+2`, ‚Ä¶ in the dialogue you can increment the house
numbers automatically.


## Keyboard shortcut

Additionally, you can add a keyboard shortcut for the address dialogue.  To do
this, under *Presets ‚Ä∫ Search preset‚Ä¶* right-click on *Annotation/Address ‚Ä∫ Add
toolbar button*. A button with a house number icon appears in the toolbar.
Finally you can right-click on it ‚Ä∫ *Edit shortcut*. This opens the settings
dialogue, where you can select a keyboard shortcut.


## Background layers

It is recommended to add the aerial images `Brandenburg GeoBasis-DE/LGB (2023):
DOP20c` and the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù map `Brandenburg GeoBasis-DE/LGB (2023): WebAtlasDE
BE/BB`. With the keys `Alt+1`, `Alt+2` etc. you can quickly hide and show
layers.


## Map style for addresses

After adding addresses, the map style
[Coloured Streets](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Styles/Coloured_Streets)
can help with quality control. E.g. you can visually see the assignment of
house numbers to streets:
